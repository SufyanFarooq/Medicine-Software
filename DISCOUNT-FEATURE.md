# Admin-Configured Discount Feature

## Overview
The Medicine Software now supports admin-configured discount percentages that are applied to the entire invoice subtotal. The admin can set a global discount percentage in the settings, and this discount will be automatically applied to all invoices.

## Features

### 1. Admin Settings
- Admin can configure discount percentage in Settings page
- Default discount is 3%
- Discount is applied to the entire invoice subtotal
- Settings are stored in the database

### 2. Invoice Generation
- Admin-configured discount is automatically applied to invoice subtotal
- Discount calculation: `Subtotal Ã— (Admin Discount Percentage / 100)`
- Final total: `Subtotal - Discount Amount`
- Invoice shows:
  - Original subtotal
  - Admin discount percentage and amount
  - Final total after discount

### 3. Database Schema
- Settings collection stores `discountPercentage` field
- Field type: Number (0-100)
- Default value: 3
